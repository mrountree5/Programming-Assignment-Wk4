Files
CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data and create the tidy data set.

run_analysis.R is the script that performs the data import, cleaning, and preparation to reach the assigned outcomes. 

There are 5 programming assignments requirements as described in the course projectâ€™s instructions that the run_analysis.R script addresses:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidy_dataset.txt is the final output data set data after following the instructions in sequence listed above.
